This application will solve the NQueens problem in python. It takes user input from the console and solves the problem for integers 1-10. It also includes unit tests for integers 1-10. 

The code is primarily generated with GPT Engineer and refactored using Github Co-pilot.

The following files are present:

1. all_output.txt: Raw output from gpt-engineer

2. `NQueens` class: This class will encapsulate the logic for solving the n-queens problem.
    - `__init__(self, size: int)`: Initializes an instance of the `NQueens` class.
    - `solve(self)`: Solves the n-queens problem.
    - `is_safe(self, board: List[List[int]], row: int, col: int)`: Checks if a queen can be placed at the given position.
    - `solve_n_queens_util(self, board: List[List[int]], col: int)`: Utility method to solve the n-queens problem.
    - `print_solution(self, board: List[List[int]])`: Prints the solution.

3. `test_n_queens.py`: This file will contain the unit tests for the `NQueens` class.
    - `test_solve()`: Tests the `solve` method of the `NQueens` class.
